# py-url-shortener

This is an educational project, based on the [System Design Walkthrough by HelloInterview](https://www.hellointerview.com/learn/system-design/answer-keys/bitly).

The ultimate goal is to show the full implementation of the project, in a small iterations using Python.

This will close the gap between theoretical System Design and the real implementation - and will show how the decisions are changing with each iteration.
